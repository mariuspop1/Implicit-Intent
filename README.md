# Implicit-Intent

This app is meant to teach new android users the concepts of implicit intents, how to use them and how to ask for permissions. In this app, I added 9 features that I consider the most important:
- Make a call to a browser
- Call a phone number
- Open the Dialer
- Open maps
- Search on maps
- Take pictures
- Show contacts
- Edit the first contact
- Add an event to calendar
